					</div>
					<div style="display:inline-block" class="FAQ-accord">
						<button class="accordion"><strong>Q.</strong> Can I swap members within the same club?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p><strong>A:</strong> A club may exchange members, but they <strong>must</strong> be of the same gender. The club must also inform Bruce Hennings, the Director of Service Leadership Program, via email at <strong>bruce@cnhkiwanis.org</strong>. When emailing, please remember to include and specify the names of <strong>both</strong> the member dropping out and the member that will be replacing him/her. <br><br>

							Name exchanges must be submitted before FEBRUARY 26, 2020. Last-minute exchanges thereafter may only be made due to emergencies and to the discretion of Bruce. <br><br>

							As for hotel swaps, the hotel <strong>WILL NOT</strong> allow any changes on-site, so please make sure to contact the Riverside Marriott for any changes or swaps by Wednesday, March 24, 2020.<br><br>
											
							If there are any inconsistencies when matching members to their room, or have proof of hotel registration, the members will not be able to pick up their Convention Registration packet. Be sure all your members are properly registered and accounted for in Convention <strong>AND</strong> Hotel Registration!</p>
						</div>
						<button class="accordion"><strong>Q.</strong> Can I add more members after submitting registration?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p><strong>A: </strong> If your club's registration has been submitted and additional members would like to attend, please <strong>DO NOT</strong> add to the original list. Instead, complete a second list with only the names of the additional student(s) and submit a second Formstack.</p>
						</div>
						<button class="accordion"><strong>Q.</strong> When is early registration due?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p><strong>A: </strong> DCON early registration is <strong>February 21, 2020 (02/21/20)</strong>. Late Registration is <strong>February 28, 2020 (02/28/20)</strong> Payments must be received by the District Office on said deadline. Hotel registration is due to the hotel on <strong>February 27, 2020 (02/27/20)</strong>. </p>
						</div>
						<button class="accordion"><strong>Q.</strong> Are the Hotel and Convention Registration separate?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p><strong>A: </strong> Yes and no. Convention registration is sent to the District Office whereas Hotel Registration is sent to the hotel. Deadlines listed above. 
						  	Although payments are sent to two different places, members must be registered for the <em>hotel AND convention center</em>to attend DCON</p>
						</div>
						<button class="accordion"><strong>Q.</strong> If I can no longer attend District Convention, can I get a refund?</button>
						<div class="panel">

						</div>
						<button class="accordion"><strong>Q.</strong> How do I register my Kiwanian/Advisor?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p><strong>A: </strong> If you are registering your Kiwanian/Advisor you may register them in the same spreadsheet as your members, but rather than selecting “Circle K/Club Member” in the drop-down menu, you’d select “Advisor” or “Kiwanian”. Make sure you ask if they would like to attend the entire event or just a certain day. 
							If they would rather register themselves, direct them to the registration link and offer assistance if needed. </p>
						</div>
						<button class="accordion"><strong>Q.</strong> How do I register Circle K Alumni or other guests who aren't Kiwanians or Advisors?</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p><strong>A: </strong> For individuals who are not Kiwanians or Advisors, they must first obtain approval from District Administrator, Armando Velazquez, before beginning the registration process. They or their Circle K member affiliate must send an email to Armondo (<a href = "mailto: administrator@cnhcirclek.org">administrator@cnhcirclek.org</a>) containing the following information: </p>
							<ul style="text-align:left;">			
								<li>Name of alumnus or guest<br></li>
								<li>Their phone number<br></li>
								<li>Why they would like to attend DCON</li>
							</ul>			
							
							<p>From there, if and when approved, the sender will be notified. Then, an approved alumnus or guest may begin the registration process for the One Day Pass.

							Please note: Approval for attendance must be done before <strong>February 26,2020 (2/26/2020)</strong>. The earlier the email is sent and the alumnus or guest is approved, the better. Attendees aside from Circle K members are not required to stay at the hotel.</p>
